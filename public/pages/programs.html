      <h3>Career Discernment Course</h3>
      <p>
        We need people who care about refugees and immigrants to join
        the community to help make it a success. Most classes have more
        than two volunteers for every student! That's because our
        students need a lot of support. You don't need to be a
        professional software engineer to help, there lots of ways to
        give your time and be a part of this amazing group of people.

      <p>
        We are seeking businesses able to take on a small cohort of
        our graduates as software engineering apprentices. Our graduates
        are motivated, smart, and eager to put everything they have
        learned into practice. Refcode will provide a plan to ensure the
        apprentices have the best chance at success during their
        apprenticeship, as well as support and guidance for both
        apprentices and the people at your company they are working with.
